# 🏥 Kidney Disease Classification

A deep learning-based system for classifying kidney disease from medical images using TensorFlow and Flask.

## 📋 Overview

This project implements a CNN-based classifier for kidney disease detection from medical images. It uses transfer learning with pre-trained models and provides both training and prediction capabilities through a web interface.

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 Deep learning model for kidney disease classification
- 🌐 Web interface for easy interaction
- 📊 Training pipeline with MLflow integration
- 🔄 DVC for data version control
- 🐳 Docker support for containerization
- 🔌 REST API endpoints for predictions

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow 2.12.0
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Data Version Control**: DVC
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Additional Libraries**: 
  - pandas, numpy for data manipulation
  - matplotlib, seaborn for visualization
  - scipy for scientific computing
  - joblib for model persistence

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/suyash-04/Kidney-Disease-Classification.git
cd Kidney-Disease-Classification
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up DVC (if using data version control):
```bash
dvc pull
```

## 💻 Usage

### 🎯 Training the Model

1. Start the training process:
```bash
python main.py
```

Or use the web interface:
- Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/train`

### 🔮 Making Predictions

1. Start the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Access the web interface:
- Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser
- Upload an image for prediction

### 🔌 API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Home page
- `GET /predict`: Prediction page
- `POST /predict`: Submit image for prediction
- `GET/POST /train`: Trigger model training

## ⚙️ Model Parameters

The model can be configured through `params.yaml`:
- EPOCHS: 20
- IMAGE_SIZE: [299, 299, 3]
- BATCH_SIZE: 10
- LEARNING_RATE: 0.01
- CLASSES: 2

## 🐳 Docker Support

Build and run the Docker container:
```bash
docker build -t kidney-disease-classifier .
docker run -p 5000:5000 kidney-disease-classifier
```
